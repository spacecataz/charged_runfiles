This PARAM.in file runs the code under the "SWPC" configuration:
--Configure with Config.pl -v=GM/BATSRUS,IM/RCM2,IE/Ridley_serial
--Low resolution (1M cells), very fast execution.

This configuration represents the "state of the art" in terms of dB/dt
forecasting at SWPC.  It will be replaced in the coming months with a
higher resolution, expanded capability version.
